Markdown is a way to write content for the web. It's written in what
people like to call "plaintext", which is exactly the sort of text
you're used to writing and seeing. Plaintext is just the regular
alphabet, with a few familiar symbols, like asterisks (
<code>*</code> ) and backticks ( <code>`</code> ).

Unlike cumbersome word processing applications, text written in
Markdown can be easily shared between computers, mobile phones, and
people. It's quickly becoming the writing standard for
[academics][academics], [scientists][scientists], [writers][writers],
and many more.  Websites like [GitHub](https://www.github.com) and
[reddit](http://www.reddit.com) use Markdown to style their comments.

Formatting text in Markdown has a very gentle learning curve. It doesn't do anything
fancy like change the font size, color, or type. All you have control over is
the display of the textâ€”stuff like making things bold, creating
headers, and organizing lists.

If you have ten minutes, you can learn Markdown!

In each lesson, you'll be given an introduction to a single Markdown
concept. Then, you'll be asked to complete several exercises with that
new knowledge.
