<div class="row">
<p>If you need to call special attention to a quote from another source, or design
  a pull quote for a magazine article, then Markdown's <em>blockquote</em> syntax
  will be useful. A blockquote is a sentence or paragraph that's been specially
  formatted to draw attention to the reader. For example:</p>
  <blockquote><p>
  "The sin of doing nothing is the
  deadliest of all the seven sins. It has been said that for evil men to accomplish
  their purpose it is only necessary that good men should do nothing."
</p></blockquote>

<p>To create a block quote, all you have to do is preface a line with the "greater than"
caret (<code>></code>). For example:
<pre>
> "In a few moments he was barefoot, his stockings folded in his pockets and his
  canvas shoes dangling by their knotted laces over his shoulders and, picking a
  pointed salt-eaten stick out of the jetsam among the rocks, he clambered down
  the slope of the breakwater."
</pre>
</p>

<p>In the box below, turn the book quotation into a blockquote:</p>
  <div class="col-md-5 scratchpad"></div>
  <span class="help-tooltip icon-question" data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="Type your answers in the left box, and the resulting Markdown appears in the right box. When your answer is correct, you'll be taken to the next lesson"></span>
  <div class="col-md-5 renderpad"></div>
</div>
<button class="btn btn-default btn-skip">Skip</button>

<div class="toBeRevealed">
  <div class="row">
  <hr>
  <p>Marvelous!</p>
  <p>You can also place a caret character on each line of the quote. This is particularly
  useful if your quote spans multiple paragraphs. For example:</p>
  <pre>
> His words seemed to have struck some deep chord in his own nature. Had he spoken
of himself, of himself as he was or wished to be? Stephen watched his face for some
moments in silence. A cold sadness was there. He had spoken of himself, of his own
loneliness which he feared.
>
> â€”Of whom are you speaking? Stephen asked at length.
>
> Cranly did not answer.</pre>
  <p>Notice that even blank lines must contain the caret character. This ensures
    that the entire blockquote is grouped together.</p>

  <p>In the box below, Make the entire quotation a block quote by inserting a caret
    on each line.</p>
    <div class="col-md-5 scratchpad"></div>
    <div class="col-md-5 renderpad"></div>
  </div>
  <button class="btn btn-default btn-skip">Skip</button>
</div>

<div class="toBeRevealed">
  <div class="row">
  <hr>
  <p>Tremendous!</p>
  <p>Block quotes can contain other Markdown elements, such as italics, images,
  or links.</p>
  <p>In the box below, make the French text italic (not including the exclamation point).
  Also, turn the entire quote into a blockquote.</p>
    <div class="col-md-5 scratchpad"></div>
    <div class="col-md-5 renderpad"></div>
  </div>
  <button class="btn btn-default btn-skip">Skip</button>
</div>

<div class="toBeRevealed">

  <p>Ta da! You've learned all there is to creating blockquotes in Markdown!</p>
  <a class="btn btn-lg btn-success" href="{{ site.data.tooltips.lesson_6[page.locale].href }}">On to the next lesson!</a>
