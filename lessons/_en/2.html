<div class="row">
<p>Let's take a look at another formatting convention: the header. Headers are
  frequently used on websites, magazine articles, and notices, to draw attention
  to a section. As their name implies, they act like titles or subtitles above
  sections.</p>

<p>There are six types of headers, in decreasing sizes:</p>
<h1>This is header one</h1>
<h2>This is header two</h2>
<h3>This is header three</h3>
<h4>This is header four</h4>
<h5>This is header five</h5>
<h6>This is header six</h6>

<p>To make headers in Markdown, you preface the phrase with a hash mark (<code>#</code>). You
place the same number of hash marks as the size of the header you want. For example,
for a header one, you'd use one hash mark (<code># Header One</code>), while for
a header three, you'd use three (<code>### Header Three</code>).</p>

<p>For this next lesson, make each header the right size.</p>

</div>
<button class="btn btn-default btn-skip">Skip</button>

  <p>All right!</p>
  <p>It's up to you to decide when it's appropriate to use which header. In general,
    headers one and six should be used sparingly.</p>
  <p>You can't really make a header bold, but you can italicize certain words. In
    the box below, make the first line a heading level four, and italicize the name of the book:</p>
    <div class="col-md-5 scratchpad"></div>
    <div class="col-md-5 renderpad"></div>
  </div>
  <button class="btn btn-default btn-skip">Skip</button>
</div>

  <p>And that's all there is to making headers in Markdown.</p>
  <a class="btn btn-lg btn-success" href="{{ site.data.tooltips.lesson_3[page.locale].href }}">On to the next lesson!</a>
