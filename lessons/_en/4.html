<p>If you know how to create links in Markdown, you can create images, too. The
  syntax is nearly the same.</p>

<p>Images also have two styles, just like links, and both of them render the exact
  same way. The difference between links and images is that images
  are prefaced with an exclamation point ( <code>!</code> ).</p>

<p>The first image style is called an <em>inline image link</em>. To create an inline
  image link, enter an exclamation point ( <code>!</code> ), wrap the alt text in brackets ( <code>[ ]</code> ), and then wrap the link
  in parenthesis ( <code>( )</code> ). (Alt text is a phrase or sentence that describes the
  image for the visually impaired.)</p>

<p>For example, to create an inline image link to https://octodex.github.com/images/bannekat.png, with an alt text
  that says, Benjamin Bannekat, you'd write this in Markdown: <code>![Benjamin Bannekat](https://octodex.github.com/images/bannekat.png)</code>.</p>

<p>In the box below, turn the link to an image, and fill out the alt text brackets
   to say "A pretty tiger":</p>
  <div class="col-md-5 scratchpad"></div>
  <span class="help-tooltip icon-question" data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="Type your answers in the left box, and the resulting Markdown appears in the right box. When your answer is correct, you'll be taken to the next lesson"></span>
  <div class="col-md-5 renderpad"></div>

  <p>Wonderful!</p>
  <p>Although you don't <em>need</em> to add alt text, it will make your content accessible to your audience,
    including people who are visually impaired, use screen readers, or do not have high speed internet connections. </p>
  <p>For a reference image, you'll follow the same pattern as a reference link.
    You'll precede the Markdown with an exclamation point, then provide two brackets
    for the alt text, and then two more for the image tag, like this: <code>![The founding father][Father]</code> At the bottom of your Markdown
    page, you'll define an image for the tag, like this: <code>[Father]: http://octodex.github.com/images/founding-father.jpg</code>.</p>
  <p>In the box below, we've started placing some reference images; you'll
    need to complete them, just like the last lesson. Call the first reference tag "Black", and make
    it link to <code>https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a3/81_INF_DIV_SSI.jpg</code>; make the
    second image link out to <code>http://icons.iconarchive.com/icons/google/noto-emoji-animals-nature/256/22221-cat-icon.png</code>.</p>
