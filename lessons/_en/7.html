  <p>Markdown has several ways of formatting paragraphs.</p>

  <p>
    Let's take a few lines of poetry as an example. Suppose you want to write
    text that looks like this:
  </p>
  <p>
    Do I contradict myself?<br />
    Very well then I contradict myself,<br />
    (I am large, I contain multitudes.)
  </p>
  <p>
    Now, you might think that simply typing each verse onto its own line would
    be enough to solve the problem:
  </p>
  <pre>
Do I contradict myself?
Very well then I contradict myself,
(I am large, I contain multitudes.)
</pre
  >
  <p>
    Unfortunately, you'd be wrong! This Markdown would render simply as a single
    straight line: Do I contradict myself? Very well then I contradict myself,
    (I am large, I contain multitudes.).
  </p>
  <p>
    If you forcefully insert a new line, you end up breaking the togetherness:
  </p>
  <pre>
Do I contradict myself?

Very well then I contradict myself,

(I am large, I contain multitudes.)
</pre
  >
  <p>
    This is what's known as a <em>hard break</em>; what our poetry asks for is a
    <em>soft break</em>. You can accomplish this by inserting two spaces
    <em>after</em> each new line. This is not possible to see, since spaces are
    invisible, but it'd look something like this:
  </p>
  <pre>
Do I contradict myself?··
Very well then I contradict myself,··
(I am large, I contain multitudes.)
</pre
  >
  <p>Each dot ( <code>·</code> ) represents a space on the keyboard.</p>

  <p>
    Let's try this technique out. In the box below, insert the necessary number
    of spaces to make the poem render correctly:
  </p>

  <div class="col-md-5 scratchpad"></div>
  <span
    class="help-tooltip icon-question"
    data-toggle="tooltip"
    data-original-title="Type your answers in the left box, and the resulting Markdown appears in the right box. When your answer is correct, you'll be taken to the next lesson"
  ></span>
  <div class="col-md-5 renderpad"></div>
</div>
<button class="btn btn-default btn-skip">Skip</button>

<div class="toBeRevealed">
  <div class="row">
    <hr />
    <p>Fantastic work!</p>
    <p>
      Aside from formatting poetry, one of the common uses for these soft breaks
      is in formatting paragraphs in lists. Recall in the previous lesson that
      we inserted a new line for multiple paragraphs within a list.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the box below, instead of using hard breaks, tighten the sub-paragraphs
      with soft breaks:
    </p>
    <div class="col-md-5 scratchpad"></div>
    <div class="col-md-5 renderpad"></div>
  </div>
  <button class="btn btn-default btn-skip">Skip</button>
</div>

<div class="toBeRevealed">
  <hr />
  <p>Et voila! You now know how to make soft breaks in Markdown!</p>
  <a
    class="btn btn-lg btn-success"
    href="{{ site.data.tooltips.conclusion[page.locale].href }}"
    >On to the next lesson!</a
